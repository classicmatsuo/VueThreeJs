# Vue + Three.js = Fly Fishing Streamer Creator

![streamer creator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/classicmatsuo/VueThreeJs/master/streamercreator1.png)

A simple VueJS and ThreeJS app where the user can add sections and change colors of a fly fishing streamer and either make it bare bones simple with one station or make it a full fledged 4x long streamer. Use it to mock up your next streamer when sitting down at the tying vise or use it to learn some VueJS or ThreeJS.

The fuzzy mesh texture is taken from [three-fuzzy-mesh](https://github.com/zadvorsky/three-fuzzy-mesh)
